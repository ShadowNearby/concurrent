# LibConcurrent - C++ Concurrent Library

LibConcurrent is a C++ library for concurrent programming, providing abstractions and utilities for multi-threaded
applications.

## Features

- **Thread Safety:** Ensure thread safety with carefully designed data structures and synchronization primitives.
- **Task Parallelism:** Facilitate task-based parallelism with a high-level interface for concurrent execution.
- **Lock-Free Algorithms:** Utilize lock-free and wait-free algorithms for efficient and scalable concurrency.
- **Atomic Operations:** Perform atomic operations and manage shared resources using atomic types.
